                    <h4> INTRODUCTION: </h4>
                    <p> Thanks to recent advances in computer science and informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare. AI algorithms and other applications powered by AI are being used to support medical professionals in clinical settings and in ongoing research. </p>
                    <p> Currently, the most common roles for AI in medical settings are clinical decision support and imaging analysis. Clinical decision support tools help providers make decisions about treatments, medications, mental health and other patient needs by providing them with quick access to information or research that's relevant to their patient. </p>
                    <p> There are numerous ways AI can positively impact the practice of medicine, whether it's through speeding up the pace of research or helping clinicians make better decisions. </p>

                    <h4> WHAT IS IT EMPLOYED FOR? </h4>
                    <p> Personalized disease treatment: </p>
                    <p> Precision medicine could become easier to support with virtual AI assistance. Because AI models can learn and retain preferences, AI has the potential to provide customized real-time recommendations to patients around the clock. </p>                    
                    <p> AI in medical imaging: </p>
                    <p> AI is already playing a prominent role in medical imaging. Research has indicated that AI powered by artificial neural networks can be just as effective as human radiologists at detecting signs of breast cancer as well as other conditions. In addition to helping clinicians spot early signs of disease, AI can also help make the staggering number of medical images. </p>
                    <p> Clinical trial efficiency: </p>
                    <p> A lot of time is spent during clinical trials assigning medical codes to patient outcomes and updating the relevant datasets. AI can help speed this process up by providing a quicker and more intelligent search for medical codes. </p>
                    <p> Accelerated drug development: </p>
                    <p> Drug discovery is often one of the longest and most costly parts of drug development. AI could help reduce the costs of developing new medicines in primarily two ways: creating better drug designs and finding promising new drug combinations. </p>

                    <h4> BENEFITS OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF AI IN MEDICINE </h4>
                    <p> AI in medicine also entails some benefits in its uses such as:</p>

                    <p>Informed Patient Care: AI integrates into clinical workflows, offering real-time, evidence-based insights to support care decisions. </p>
                        
                    <p>Error Reduction: AI-powered tools improve patient safety by enhancing error detection and drug management. </p>
                        
                    <p>Reducing the Costs of Care: AI helps reduce healthcare costs through medication error reduction, fraud prevention, and workflow optimization. </p>
                        
                    <p>Increasing Doctor-Patient Engagement: Chatbots and AI systems provide 24/7 support and help triage patient questions effectively. </p>
                        
                    <p>Providing Contextual Relevance: AI uses context to accurately interpret and manage medical information for improved patient outcomes. </p>
