                    <h4> Introduction to Fundamentals to Computing Engineering </h4>
                    <p> During this site, i Will exaplain what is "Fundamentals Of Computing Engineering" and all its main facets, which involve five principal sections: Computer Engineering in Society, Paradigms and trends in systems and applications, Information and Data, Software Development and Web Applications. </p>

                    <h4> Computer Engineering in Society </h4>
                    <p> During this phase, we can observe different facets of the evolution of technologies and computers, specifying their timeline and key characteristics, as well as the development of some components by hardware, such as the microprocessor, or factors like fiber optics and their related technologies. On the other hand, we can also find the current situation of modern technologies, their characteristics, and benefits. This section also references the potential career opportunities offered by computer engineering, the supply and demand for work, and identifies and distinguishes some of the most popular professions. It also emphasizes the personal curriculum and the key aspects of an excellent employee. </p>

                    <h4> Current paradigms and trends in systems and applications </h4>
                    <p> Some of the topics related to the main trends in systems and applications can include hardware, which consists of the physical face of current technology, covering elements such as types of personal computers, components, or the history of hardware development. Regarding software, we can define it as a set of instructions called programs that are used to operate computers that perform specific tasks. In this sector, the stages of program development are specified, the methods and tools for developing it, and how the computer transforms the code to the CPU. On the other hand, the role of operating systems is illustrated, which represent the system software responsible for managing the hardware and software resources of the computer, as well as providing essential services to the computer programs. This area emphasizes its main functions and operations. Finally, we can highlight analog networks, telecommunications, and the history of their development. </p>

                    <h4> Information and Data </h4>
                    <p> In this section of the subject, we can find basic knowledge about data, information, and their differences and similarities, as well as how they are used in computers. Additionally, we learn about numerical systems, highlighting binary numbers and their conversion, such as from binary to decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, along with their properties. This section also includes Big Data, related to the concept of information and databases like "Github." Other aspects of Big Data that stand out include its legal side, referring to data protection and its evolution over time, raising ethical questions about the use of personal data that each of us provides and connecting it to computer engineering. </p>

                    <h4> Software development </h4>
                    <p> Software development refers to the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software systems or applications. In this section of the subject, we explore in depth the creation of software, focusing on databases such as in the case of 'Git' and tools like 'Github' used to perform various tasks. On the other hand, we can highlight the concept of 'IDE' (Integrated Development Environment), where we have explored different tools necessary for the proper development of software creation, such as 'Project Management tools' and their functionality. These tools are also integrated with Github for project creation through programming. </p>

                    <h4> Web Applications </h4>
                    <p> During this block of the subject, we explore the main aspects of the programming language 'HTML' (HyperText Markup Language), referring to the creation of websites, showing the main tools and requirements to properly tackle the projects that students undertake. This block emphasizes the programming language, along with various codes and commands to run the website. Additionally, it shows us how to create a basic design for our projects, based on a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) system. </p>
