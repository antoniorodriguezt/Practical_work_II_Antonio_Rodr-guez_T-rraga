##PRACTICAL ii 

#DESCRIPTION

This project is based on a website, which is divided into several sections: Index, Degree, About, Topic, Contact, and Net.

-First, we have the Index, where the user can interact with my photo to view my CV, and my social media links at the bottom. Additionally, the various sections can be found at the top right. To return to the homepage, users simply need to click on my name, 'Antonio.'

-The 'Degree' section provides a brief explanation of the degree I am pursuing, including its details, curiosities, and what it entails. It consists of four parts, as I am studying a double degree in Business Analytics and Computer Engineering. Each program is explained in a separate section, and the website also displays the subjects of the degree and their professional opportunities.

-The 'Contact' section allows users to reach out to me for any reason. I have provided my email, phone number, social media links, and a direct contact option through my email.

-In the 'Net' section, I have included links to various websites of my colleagues so that users can explore their projects.

-The 'Topic' section delves into the field of medicine and its relationship with Artificial Intelligence (AI), exploring the main areas where it is applied and its benefits.

-The website also features an 'About' section, where I give a brief overview of myself, my academic background, and why I chose this degree, as well as my goals and ambitions.

#TROUBLES

During the development of this website, I faced plenty os troubles and erros in the code, the most of all, when i started programming since i had not programmed for ages thats the reason why I had to study again all the code I practised. Also, at the end of the proyect i faced another trouble in github because of the branches. Other problem i had, could be the time to conclude the canvas task so I didnÂ´t organise myself correctly.
